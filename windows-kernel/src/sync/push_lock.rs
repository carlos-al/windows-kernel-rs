/// A [`PushLock`] is an efficient implementation of a reader-writer lock that can be stored both
/// in paged and non-paged memory.
///
/// This type of lock allows a number of readers or at most one writer at any point in time. The
/// write portion of this lock typically allows modifications of the underlying data (exclusive
/// access) and the read portion of this lock typically allows for read-only access (shared
/// access).
///
/// In comparison, a [`FastMutex`] does not distinguish between readers or writers that acquire the
/// lock, therefore blocking any threads waiting for the lock to become available. A [`PushLock`]
/// will allow any number of readers to acquire the lock as long as a writer is not holding the
/// lock.
///
/// The priority policy is such that a thread trying to acquire the [`PushLock`] for exclusive
/// access will be prioritized over threads trying to acquire the [`PushLock`] for shared access.
/// More specifically, if a thread cannot lock the [`PushLock`] for exclusive access immediately,
/// it will wait for the thread(s) that currently holds the lock to release the lock. If another
/// thread tries to acquire the [`PushLock`] for shared access while a thread is waiting to acquire
/// the lock for exclusive access, it will yield to the thread(s) trying to acquire the
/// [`PushLock`] for exclusive access, even in the event that the [`PushLock`] is acquired for
/// shared access.
